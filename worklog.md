Task: Create improved homepage prototype for JobReady.co.ke

Work Log:
- Read two uploaded sample HTML homepages (deepseek_html_20260330_18aef4.html and deepseek_html_20260330_06af1b.html)
- Read existing finalized prototypes (job detail page and hub page) to extract shared design language
- Analyzed sample strengths: deadline urgency cards, category grids, company logos on jobs, sidebar service CTAs
- Identified sample weaknesses: different CSS/color system, no mobile hamburger drawer, no WhatsApp float, no CV modal, emoji-heavy, no proper SVG icons
- Built comprehensive homepage prototype at /home/z/my-project/download/jobready-homepage-prototype.html

Stage Summary:
- Created jobready-homepage-prototype.html with full design system match
- Key improvements over samples: matching CSS variables, proper header with hamburger drawer, WhatsApp floating button, CV modal intercept funnel, SVG icons throughout (no emoji overload), "Trusted By" employer bar, better deadline urgency cards, 3-state salary display, save/bookmark toggles, newsletter form, browse-by-location sidebar, proper responsive breakpoints
- Homepage sections: Top Bar → Header → Hero (search + stats + quick links) → Trusted By → Ad Leaderboard → Main Layout (Closing Today, Trending Now, Browse by Category, Service Nudge, Latest Jobs, In-content Ad, Scholarships & Opportunities, Government Jobs) + Sidebar (CV Review Card, Ad, Featured Jobs, Top Employers, Email Alerts, Urgent Deadlines, Browse by Location, Ad) → Footer → WhatsApp Float → CV Modal
- All links use /jobs/, /opportunities/, /organizations/ URL structure matching the 33 hub pages plan

## Task ID: 7 - theme-setup
### Work Task
Set up the Tailwind CSS theme for JobReady.co.ke — update tailwind.config.ts and globals.css to map prototype CSS variables to Tailwind utility classes, removing all component-specific CSS in favor of Tailwind utilities.

### Work Summary
- **tailwind.config.ts**: Replaced entire config with JobReady theme. Kept `darkMode: "class"`, set content to `./src/**/*.{js,jsx,mdx}`, mapped all prototype colors as direct hex values (primary/dark/light, secondary/dark/light, accent/light, purple/light, danger/light, gray-50 through gray-900, white), added boxShadow (sm/DEFAULT/md/lg matching prototype), borderRadius (sm=6px/DEFAULT=8px/lg=12px/xl=16px), fontFamily with system font stack, maxWidth container=1200px, fontSize scale, and kept tailwindcss-animate plugin.
- **globals.css**: Stripped 382-line file down to 84 lines. Kept only: `@import "tailwindcss"`, box-sizing reset, `:root` CSS variables (colors, shadows, radii as source of truth for JSON-LD/SEO helpers), body base styles (font-family, color, background, line-height, -webkit-font-smoothing), `.container` utility, `::-webkit-scrollbar` styles, and `@keyframes wa-fade` animation. Removed all component-specific CSS classes (.top-bar, .header, .nav, .hero, .footer, .btn, .job-list-card, .sidebar-card, .company-jobs, .mobile-menu-btn, .cv-modal, .wa-float, .pain-trigger, .service-nudge, etc.) and all responsive media queries — these will now be handled entirely by Tailwind utility classes.
- Lint passes with zero errors. Dev server compiles successfully.

   - GoogleOAuthProvider placeholder (commented, for Batch 3C)
   - Custom pages: signIn → `/auth/login`, error → `/auth/login`
   - Sign-in/sign-out event logging

2. **`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`** — NextAuth route handler
   - Exports GET and POST handlers wrapping NextAuth(authOptions)

3. **`src/app/api/auth/register/route.js`** — Registration API

   - Normalizes phone to 254XXXXXXXXX format
   - Checks for existing email/phone
   - Hashes password with bcrypt (12 rounds)
   - Creates User + AuthAccount(provider: "email") in Prisma transaction
   - Returns user without passwordHash (201)
   - Handles P2002 unique constraint violations (409)

4. **`src/app/api/auth/send-otp/route.js`** — Send OTP API

   - Rate limiting: rejects if OTP sent within last 60 seconds (429)
   - Generates 6-digit OTP (crypto.randomInt), 10-minute expiry
   - Upserts AuthAccount(provider: "phone") with OTP in accessToken field
   - Logs OTP to console for development (SMS integration is TODO)

5. **`src/app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.js`** — Verify OTP API
   - Validates phone + 6-digit OTP
   - Finds AuthAccount by phone, checks OTP match + expiry
   - Finds or creates user (placeholder email for phone-only users)
   - Marks phoneVerified: true, updates lastLoginAt
   - Links auth account to user, deletes OTP record
   - Handles P2002 for email conflicts

6. **`src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.js`** — Forgot Password API
   - Validates email, finds user (always returns same success message to prevent email enumeration)
   - Checks for password (OAuth-only users skipped)
   - Generates 32-byte hex reset token (crypto.randomBytes), 1-hour expiry
   - Deletes existing reset tokens, creates new AuthAccount(provider: "reset")

   - Matcher excludes static files

10. **`src/components/AuthProvider.jsx`** — NextAuth SessionProvider wrapper
    - `"use client"` component wrapping children in SessionProvider
    - Required for useSession/useAuth hooks to work

**Files Modified (2):**
- **`src/app/layout.jsx`** — Added AuthProvider wrapper around children in root layout
- **`.env`** — Added NEXTAUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_URL

**Key Technical Notes:**
- All files are `.js` or `.jsx` (no TypeScript) as per project rules

- All API routes use try/catch with proper HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 409, 429, 500)
- Prisma transactions used for atomic multi-model operations
- Auth uses AuthAccount table for multi-provider support (not NextAuth's default Account model)

**Verification:**
- ESLint: zero errors
- `npx prisma generate`: successful
- `npm run build`: successful — all 6 API routes registered as dynamic (ƒ)
  - `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`
  - `/api/auth/forgot-password`
  - `/api/auth/register`
  - `/api/auth/reset-password`
  - `/api/auth/send-otp`

## Task ID: 3B - frontend-developer
### Work Task
Build Phase 3B — Authentication Pages for JobReady.co.ke. Create auth layout, 6 auth pages (login, register, forgot-password, reset-password, verify-email, verify-phone), and 5 shared auth components (InputField, AuthCard, PasswordStrength, OtpInput, SocialLoginButtons). All files must be .jsx (no TypeScript), use plain Tailwind only (no shadcn/ui for auth), React Icons, brand colors #1a56db / #f59e0b.

### Work Summary
Created 13 files across auth layout, 6 auth pages, and 5 shared components. All files are .jsx using plain Tailwind CSS (no shadcn/ui), React Icons (FiMail, FiLock, FiPhone, FiArrowRight, FiLoader, FiCheck, FiAlertCircle, FiEye, FiEyeOff, FiUser, FiArrowLeft). ESLint passes with zero errors, dev server compiles successfully, all 6 auth pages return HTTP 200.

**Auth Layout (`src/app/(auth)/layout.jsx`):**
- Clean standalone layout with NO TopBar/Header/Footer
- `min-h-screen bg-gray-50` background
- SEO metadata with title template "Sign In | JobReady Kenya"
- Root layout already provides AuthProvider (SessionProvider)

**Shared Auth Components (`src/app/(auth)/_components/`):**

1. **`AuthCard.jsx`** — Card wrapper with centered layout, JobReady logo, white card with shadow, subtle decorative background circles. Max-width 440px, responsive padding.

2. **`InputField.jsx`** — Reusable input with label, left icon support, password show/hide toggle (FiEye/FiEyeOff), error display, helper text. Supports text/email/password/tel/number types. Focus ring in brand blue.

3. **`PasswordStrength.jsx`** — Visual password strength indicator with progress bar and 5 checks (length 8+, A-Z, a-z, 0-9, special chars). Three levels: Weak (red, 1/3 bar), Fair (amber, 2/3 bar), Strong (green, full bar). Shows requirement badges.

4. **`OtpInput.jsx`** — 6-digit OTP input with 6 individual boxes. Auto-focus to next on input, backspace goes to previous, supports paste event (full OTP), keyboard arrow navigation, focused state ring.

5. **`SocialLoginButtons.jsx`** — Google login button with inline Google SVG logo (multi-color), uses `signIn("google")` from next-auth/react. Divider with "OR" text. Loading spinner state.

**Auth Pages (`src/app/(auth)/auth/`):**

1. **Login (`/auth/login`):**
   - Two-tab interface: Email / Phone
   - Email tab: email + password inputs with FiMail/FiLock icons, "Forgot password?" link, Sign In button with loading spinner, SocialLoginButtons, "Don't have an account? Sign Up" link
   - Phone tab: phone input with +254 prefix (numeric only), "Send OTP" button → shows 6-digit OtpInput with "Verify & Sign In" button, 60-second resend countdown, "Use different number" back button
   - Form validation with inline errors
   - Uses `signIn("credentials", { redirect: false })` from next-auth/react
   - Uses `useAuth()` from `@/lib/useSession` — redirects if already authenticated
   - Reads `callbackUrl` and `error` from URL search params
   - Error messages for OAuth errors (OAuthAccountNotLinked, CredentialsSignin, etc.)

2. **Register (`/auth/register`):**
   - Full Name, Email, Phone (optional with +254 prefix), Password (with strength indicator), Confirm Password, Terms checkbox
   - Complete form validation: name min 2 chars, email format, Kenyan phone format, password min 8 chars, password match, terms required
   - Custom styled checkbox with FiCheck icon
   - POSTs to `/api/auth/register`
   - On success: redirects to `/auth/login?registered=true`
   - Success state screen with green checkmark when `registered=true` param present
   - SocialLoginButtons for Google sign-up
   - "Already have an account? Sign In" link

3. **Forgot Password (`/auth/forgot-password`):**
   - "Reset your password" heading with instructional text
   - Email input with FiMail icon
   - "Send Reset Link" button with loading state
   - Success state: green checkmark, "Check your email" message, "try again" link, "Back to Sign In" button
   - Back to Sign In link at top with FiArrowLeft
   - POSTs to `/api/auth/forgot-password`

4. **Reset Password (`/auth/reset-password?token=xxx`):**
   - Wrapped in Suspense for useSearchParams
   - Token validation on mount (must be 32+ chars)
   - Invalid token state: red alert with "Request New Link" button
   - New Password + Confirm Password with PasswordStrength
   - POSTs to `/api/auth/reset-password` with token + newPassword
   - Success state: green checkmark, redirect to `/auth/login?reset=true`
   - Back to Sign In link

5. **Verify Email (`/auth/verify-email?token=xxx`):**
   - Wrapped in Suspense for useSearchParams
   - Three states: loading (spinner), success (green checkmark), error (red alert)
   - Simulated verification for development (TODO: actual API call)
   - "Continue to Sign In" button on success

6. **Verify Phone (`/auth/verify-phone?phone=xxx`):**
   - Wrapped in Suspense for useSearchParams
   - Reads phone from URL params
   - No-phone state: amber warning with "Go to Sign In" button
   - Phone display in gray card with FiPhone icon
   - OtpInput with "Verify" button
   - Resend OTP with 60-second countdown
   - POSTs to `/api/auth/verify-otp` and `/api/auth/send-otp`
   - Success state: green checkmark, "Continue to Sign In"

**Design Consistency:**
- Card: `bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-sm p-6 md:p-8 border border-gray-100`
- Input: `border-gray-200 rounded-xl text-sm focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#1a56db]/20 focus:border-[#1a56db]`
- Primary button: `bg-[#1a56db] hover:bg-[#1e40af] text-white rounded-xl font-semibold text-sm`
- Error text: `text-xs text-red-500 mt-1`
- Links: `text-[#1a56db] hover:underline font-medium`
- Loading spinner: FiLoader with `animate-spin`
- All pages use AuthCard wrapper with JobReady logo

**File Structure:**
```
src/app/(auth)/
├── layout.jsx
├── _components/
│   ├── AuthCard.jsx
│   ├── InputField.jsx
│   ├── PasswordStrength.jsx
│   ├── OtpInput.jsx
│   └── SocialLoginButtons.jsx
└── auth/
    ├── login/page.jsx
    ├── register/page.jsx
    ├── forgot-password/page.jsx
    ├── reset-password/page.jsx
    ├── verify-email/page.jsx
    └── verify-phone/page.jsx
```

**Integration Notes:**
- All auth pages integrate with existing API routes: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/forgot-password`, `/api/auth/reset-password`, `/api/auth/send-otp`, `/api/auth/verify-otp`
- Login page uses NextAuth `signIn("credentials")` for email login
- SocialLoginButtons uses NextAuth `signIn("google")` (Google provider commented out in auth.js — placeholder ready)
- AuthProvider (SessionProvider) comes from root layout — no duplication in auth layout
- All auth URLs match NextAuth config: `pages.signIn = "/auth/login"`, `pages.error = "/auth/login"`
- Header component links to `/auth/login` — correctly routes to auth login page

Task ID: 3B-suspense
Agent: sub-agent
Task: Add Suspense boundaries to all auth pages that use useSearchParams()

Work Log:
- Read login/page.jsx (reference pattern), register/page.jsx, reset-password/page.jsx, verify-phone/page.jsx, verify-email/page.jsx
- Found that reset-password, verify-phone, and verify-email already had Suspense boundaries applied
- Only register/page.jsx was missing the Suspense wrapper
- Added `Suspense` to React import, renamed `export default function RegisterPage()` → `function RegisterForm()`, added new `export default function RegisterPage()` wrapping `RegisterForm` in `<Suspense>` with AuthCard + FiLoader fallback
- Build passed successfully with zero errors

Stage Summary:
- 1 file modified: `src/app/(auth)/register/page.jsx`
- 3 files already correct: reset-password/page.jsx, verify-phone/page.jsx, verify-email/page.jsx
- login/page.jsx left untouched as instructed
- `npm run build` completes successfully

## Task ID: 3C - fullstack-developer
### Work Task
Build Phase 3C: Google OAuth, Session Management, User Menu, and Protected Routes for JobReady.co.ke

### Work Summary

**Files Modified (3):**

1. **`src/lib/auth.js`** — Completed Google OAuth Provider
   - Added `GoogleProvider` import from `next-auth/providers/google`
   - Configured GoogleProvider with `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `authorization` params (consent + offline access)
   - Added `signIn` callback: handles Google OAuth sign-in by finding/creating `User` + `AuthAccount(provider: "google")` records. Updates tokens on re-login, marks email as verified, updates name/avatar from Google profile.
   - JWT and session callbacks unchanged (already correct for embedding user data)

2. **`src/middleware.js`** — Improved route protection
   - Added more auth-related routes to `publicPrefixes`: `/api/user`, `/api/jobs`, `/api/opportunities`, `/api/blog`, `/api/companies`, `/auth`
   - Added `/verify-email`, `/verify-phone` to `publicRoutes` array
   - Added `/uploads`, `/static` to static file allowlist
   - Protected routes remain: `/dashboard/*` → redirect to `/auth/login?callbackUrl=...`
   - Updated matcher to exclude font files (woff, woff2)

3. **`.env`** — Added Google OAuth placeholders
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-here` with setup instructions in comments
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret-here` with instructions

**Files Created (4):**

4. **`src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`** — Client-side route guard
   - Uses `useAuth()` hook to check authentication state
   - Loading state: full-page centered spinner with "Loading your session..."
   - Unauthenticated: redirects to `/auth/login?callbackUrl={encoded pathname}`
   - Authenticated: renders children

5. **`src/app/api/user/profile/route.js`** — User profile API
   - `GET`: returns user profile (name, email, phone, avatar, bio, location, linkedinUrl, education, skills, cvUrl, verification status, timestamps, relation counts)
   - `PUT`: updates profile fields (name, bio, location, linkedinUrl, education, skills) with validation (non-empty name, URL format for LinkedIn, max 20 skills)
   - Both endpoints require authentication via `getServerSession(authOptions)`, return 401 if unauthenticated

6. **`src/app/api/user/avatar/route.js`** — Avatar upload API
   - `POST`: accepts multipart/form-data with `avatar` field
   - Validates file type (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and size (max 2MB)
   - Saves to `public/uploads/avatars/{userId}-{timestamp}.{ext}`
   - Updates `user.avatar` in DB with the public URL path
   - Requires authentication, returns 401 if unauthenticated

7. **`src/app/(website)/_components/Header.jsx`** — Added user menu dropdown
   - Imports `useAuth` from `@/lib/useSession` and `signOut` from `next-auth/react`
   - New `UserMenu` component: avatar circle with first initial (or user image), click-to-toggle dropdown
   - Dropdown features: user name + email header, links to Dashboard/Profile/Saved Jobs/Job Alerts with lucide icons, divider, Sign Out button
   - Click-outside-to-close via `useRef` + `mousedown`/`touchstart` listeners
   - When authenticated: UserMenu replaces "Sign In" button on desktop
   - When not authenticated: "Sign In" button remains as-is

8. **`src/app/(website)/_components/MobileNav.jsx`** — Added user section for mobile
   - When authenticated: shows user info card (avatar + name + email), dashboard links (Dashboard, Profile, Saved Jobs, Job Alerts), Sign Out button replaces Sign In
   - When not authenticated: Sign In button remains as-is
   - Dashboard links use primary-colored icons to distinguish from regular nav

**File Verified (1):**
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` — Already correct: exports GET and POST using NextAuth handler with authOptions

**Build Results:**
- ESLint: zero errors
- Dev server: all pages compile successfully, `GET / 200` responses normal

## Task ID: 2i - frontend-developer
### Work Task
Build 5 Legal/CMS pages for JobReady.co.ke: About, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policy. Also create a shared LegalLayout component.

### Work Summary
Created 7 files across 5 pages + 1 shared component. All files are `.jsx` (no TypeScript), use Tailwind utility classes, react-icons, and follow existing project patterns. ESLint passes with zero errors, `npm run build` succeeds with all 5 routes statically generated.

**Shared Component:**

**1. `src/app/(website)/_components/LegalLayout.jsx`** — Client component with auto-generated sticky table of contents sidebar. Uses IntersectionObserver for scroll-spy active heading highlighting. Props: `title`, `lastUpdated`, `children`. Extracts h2[id] headings from children. Responsive: sidebar hidden on mobile, visible on lg+. Smooth scroll-to-section on TOC click. Breadcrumbs: Home > {title}.

**2. `/about` — About JobReady**
- Route: `src/app/(website)/about/page.jsx` — Server component with generateMeta SEO
- 7 sections: Hero (blue gradient, H1, subtitle), Our Mission (centered text), Who We Are (2-col: text + blue feature card with checklist), What We Do (3-col cards: Job Board, CV Writing, Career Resources with icons), Our Impact (4-stat grid: 10,000+ jobs, 5,000+ companies, 50,000+ job seekers, 92% success rate), Our Values (4-col: Trust, Accessibility, Speed, Quality), Final CTA (blue gradient, Browse Jobs + Get CV Done buttons)
- Icons: FiSearch, FiFileText, FiBookOpen, FiCheckCircle, FiTarget, FiUsers, FiTrendingUp

**3. `/contact` — Contact Us**
- Route: `src/app/(website)/contact/page.jsx` — Server component with generateMeta SEO
- Route: `src/app/(website)/contact/_components/ContactForm.jsx` — Client component
- Hero section (blue gradient), 2-column layout: left = contact form (name, email, subject dropdown with 8 options, message textarea, submit with loading state), right = 4 contact info cards (Email, Phone, WhatsApp with live link to siteConfig, Office location) + Office hours card (Mon-Fri 8-6pm, Sat 9-1pm, Sun closed, EAT timezone)
- Form simulates submission with 1.2s delay, shows success state with green checkmark and "Send another message" link
- Contact info uses data from siteConfig (email.support, whatsapp.number/display/link)

**4. `/privacy` — Privacy Policy**
- Route: `src/app/(website)/privacy/page.jsx` — Server component using LegalLayout
- 10 sections with id attributes for TOC: Introduction (ODPC compliance, effective April 2026), Information We Collect (personal info, usage data, cookies — with h3 subsections), How We Use Your Information (8 purposes), Data Sharing & Third Parties (4 scenarios), Data Security (5 measures), Your Rights (7 rights per Kenya DPA 2019 + DPO contact email), Cookies Policy (link to /cookies), Children's Privacy (under-18 restriction), Changes to This Policy (3 notification methods), Contact Us (DPO email, support email, /contact link)

- External links: Google Analytics opt-out, Google Ads Settings, NAI, DAA

**Technical Notes:**
- All pages use `generateMeta()` from `@/lib/seo` for consistent SEO metadata (title, description, canonical, OG, Twitter)
- Legal pages share `LegalLayout.jsx` for consistent TOC sidebar, breadcrumbs, and typography
- About and Contact pages use full-width hero sections matching existing pages (cv-services, career-advice)
- Contact form is client-side only (no API endpoint), with loading/success states
- All icons from `react-icons/fi`
- All files use only Tailwind utility classes (bg-[#1a56db], bg-[#f59e0b], etc.)
- Build: all 5 routes shown as `○ (Static)` — prerendered as static content

## Task ID: 10 - api-routes
### Work Task
Build 6 backend API routes for JobReady.co.ke: Saved Jobs, Alerts, Search, Dashboard Stats, Newsletter, and Notifications.

### Work Summary
Read prisma/schema.prisma (28 tables), existing lib files (db.js, auth.js, format.js, slug.js), and existing API routes (user/profile, auth/register) to understand project patterns. Created 6 API route files:

**1. `src/app/api/saved-jobs/route.js`** — Saved Jobs CRUD
- GET: Returns user's saved jobs with pagination, includes job relation (title, slug, company, location, jobType, salaryMin, salaryMax, deadline)
- POST: Saves a job (validates job exists, checks not already saved, uses @@unique userId_jobId)
- DELETE: Removes saved job using composite unique key
- Auth required for all methods. Uses Prisma parallel queries for count+data.

**2. `src/app/api/alerts/route.js`** — Job Alerts CRUD
- GET: Returns user's alerts with all fields (id, query, location, jobType, category, isActive, lastSentAt, emailOpenCount, emailClickCount)
- POST: Creates alert. Maps `keyword` param to schema `query` field. Validates at least one search criterion.
- PUT: Updates alert fields (isActive, keyword→query, location, categoryId→category). Verifies ownership.
- DELETE: Deletes alert with ownership check.
- Note: Schema has `query` not `keyword`, and no `frequency` field. API accepts `keyword` and `frequency` for backward compatibility but only persists `query`, `location`, `category`.

**3. `src/app/api/search/route.js`** — Global Search (Public)
- GET: No auth required. Searches across jobs (title, description, company.name), opportunities (title, description, organizationName), companies (name, description, industry), articles (title, excerpt, content).
- Filters: category, location, jobType. Type filter: "all", "jobs", "opportunities", "companies", "articles".
- Uses Prisma `contains` with `mode: "insensitive"` for case-insensitive search.
- Returns results grouped by type with items and total counts per type.
- Pagination with page/limit params.

**4. `src/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.js`** — Dashboard Stats
- GET: Auth required. Returns stats for job seekers (default role since User model has no role field).
- Stats: savedJobsCount, unreadNotifications, jobAlertsCount, ordersCount. Application-related counts return 0 (no Applications table in v1).
- Recent: Last 5 saved jobs with full job relation.
- Employer path included as stub for future use.

**5. `src/app/api/newsletter/route.js`** — Newsletter Subscription (Public)
- POST: No auth required. Validates email format and subscription type (job_alerts, career_tips, opportunity_alerts, employer_updates).
- Handles existing subscriptions: re-activates and updates type if email already exists (unique constraint on email).
- Uses upsert pattern to handle race conditions with P2002 error fallback.

**6. `src/app/api/notifications/route.js`** — Notifications CRUD
- GET: Auth required. Returns paginated notifications with unreadCount. Supports unreadOnly filter and optional markReadId param to mark-as-read inline.
- PUT: Supports marking single notification as read ({ id, isRead: true }) or all as read ({ markAllRead: true }).

**Schema Adaptations:**
- All IDs are String (cuid), not integer — adapted all API inputs/outputs accordingly
- JobAlert.query field used instead of "keyword" (mapped in API layer)
- JobAlert has no frequency field (accepted but not persisted)
- No Applications table exists (dashboard returns 0 for application counts)
- User model has no role field (defaults to JOB_SEEKER)
- NewsletterSubscription email is unique (one record per email)

**Build Results:**
- ESLint: zero errors
- `next build`: Compiled successfully in 9.2s
- All 6 new API routes registered as ƒ (Dynamic): /api/saved-jobs, /api/alerts, /api/search, /api/dashboard/stats, /api/newsletter, /api/notifications

- Created `src/app/api/notifications/route.js` — GET (user notifications with unreadCount) + PUT (mark read/mark all)

Stage Summary:
- 6 new API route files with 13 endpoints total
- Total API endpoints: 24 (6 existing + 18 new)
- All endpoints have proper auth checks, error handling, pagination
- Build verified: all routes registered as dynamic server-rendered endpoints

## Task ID: 8a-part3
### Work Task
Create 1 API route for company profiles at `/src/app/api/companies/[slug]/route.js` — GET handler for fetching a single company by slug with its active jobs (paginated) and similar companies.

### Work Summary
- Read worklog.md, existing `/api/jobs/[slug]/route.js` for patterns, and Prisma schema for Company/Job models
- Created `/src/app/api/companies/[slug]/route.js` with single GET handler:
  - Validates slug param, returns 400 if missing
  - Finds company by slug via `db.company.findUnique()`, returns 404 if not found or inactive (`isActive: false`)
  - Parses `page` (default 1) and `limit` (default 10, max 50) from query params
  - Builds active jobs where clause: `companyId` match, `isActive=true`, `publishedAt` not null and ≤ now, `deadline` not past or null
  - Counts total active jobs via `db.job.count()` for pagination
  - Fetches paginated jobs with `isFeatured desc, publishedAt desc` ordering, includes company select (name, slug, logo, logoColor, isVerified)
  - Fetches similar companies: same industry, different id, active, ordered by `isFeatured desc, jobCount desc`, take 5 (only if company has an industry)
  - Returns `{ company, jobs, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages }, similarCompanies }`
- Public route (no auth) — no next-auth imports
- Follows exact same code patterns as `/api/jobs/[slug]/route.js`: try/catch with console.error, NextResponse.json, same date helper logic
- ESLint passes with zero errors
- File verified to exist at `/home/z/my-project/src/app/api/companies/[slug]/route.js`

## Task ID: 8a-part1 - api-developer
### Work Task
Create 2 API routes for opportunities: GET /api/opportunities (listing with filters/pagination) and GET /api/opportunities/[slug] (detail with similar opportunities).

### Work Summary
Created 2 API route files following the exact same patterns as the existing `/api/jobs/` routes:

**1. `/src/app/api/opportunities/route.js` — GET /api/opportunities**
- Query params: `q`, `opportunityType`, `category`, `location`, `isRemote`, `sort` (newest/featured/deadline), `page`, `limit`
- Filters: isActive=true, publishedAt not null and <= now, deadline not past (or null)
- Search: title, description, organizationName (case insensitive via `mode: "insensitive"`)
- Uses `select` for listing response (excludes description/SEO fields from listing)
- Organization fields: organizationName, organizationLogo, organizationType
- Returns `{ opportunities, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }`
- Public route (no auth)
- Limit clamped to max 50

**2. `/src/app/api/opportunities/[slug]/route.js` — GET /api/opportunities/[slug]**
- Finds opportunity by slug with all fields (full details)
- Increments viewsCount fire-and-forget (no await, .catch(() => {}))
- Finds similar opportunities: same opportunityType, different id, isActive=true, published, deadline not past
- Limits similar results to 5, ordered by publishedAt desc
- Returns `{ opportunity, similarOpportunities }`
- Public route (no auth)

**Key differences from Jobs API:**
- No company FK relation — uses organizationName/organizationLogo/organizationType string fields
- No experienceLevel, salaryMin, salaryMax, jobType fields
- Search includes organizationName in addition to title and description
- Similar opportunities matched by opportunityType instead of category
- Uses `db.opportunity` instead of `db.job`

- ESLint: zero errors. Both files verified to exist.

## Task ID: 8a-part2 - backend-developer
### Work Task
Create 2 API routes for blog articles: GET /api/articles (list/search with filters) and GET /api/articles/[slug] (single article with related articles and view count). All files must be `.js`, follow exact same patterns as existing `/api/jobs/route.js`.

### Work Summary
Created 2 API route files for blog articles:

**1. `/src/app/api/articles/route.js`** — GET /api/articles (130 lines)
- Query params: `q`, `category` (slug), `tag` (slug), `author` (slug), `sort` (newest/featured/popular), `page`, `limit`
- Filters: `isPublished=true`, search in title/excerpt/content (case-insensitive)
- Includes: category (id, name, slug, color), author (id, name, slug, title, avatar), tags via articleTags→tag (id, name, slug) normalized to flat array
- Sort: newest=publishedAt desc, featured=isFeatured desc then publishedAt desc, popular=viewsCount desc then publishedAt desc
- Returns `{ articles, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }`
- Public route (no auth), limit clamped to max 50

**2. `/src/app/api/articles/[slug]/route.js`** — GET /api/articles/[slug] (111 lines)
- Finds article by slug, must be isPublished=true (returns 404 if not found/unpublished)
- Includes: author full details (id, name, slug, title, bio, avatar, linkedinUrl, articleCount, totalViews, peopleCoached), category (id, name, slug, color, gradient), tags via articleTags→tag normalized to flat array
- Increments article viewsCount (fire and forget with .catch)
- Increments author totalViews (fire and forget with .catch)
- Related articles: same categoryId, different id, isPublished=true, take 3, ordered by publishedAt desc, includes category and author
- Returns `{ article, relatedArticles }`

Both files follow exact same patterns as `/api/jobs/route.js`: try/catch with console.error, NextResponse.json, AND conditions array for clean where clause composition. ESLint: zero errors (pre-existing errors in seed/hub files are unrelated).

## Task ID: 8b-part1 - frontend-developer
### Work Task
Wire 2 frontend pages (Search Results and Job Detail) to use real API data instead of mock data.

### Work Summary
Replaced mock data imports with live API calls on 2 pages across 4 files. All existing UI preserved — only data sources changed.

**Files Modified:**

**1. `src/app/(website)/search/_components/SearchResultsList.jsx`** — Full rewrite of data layer
- Removed imports of `mockJobResults` and `mockOpportunityResults` from `./mock-data`
- Added `useState` (results, loading, error) + `useEffect` + `useCallback` for `fetch()`
- Added new props: `location` (string) and `initialType` (string, "jobs"|"opportunities")
- Fetches from `/api/search?q=${query}&type=${activeTab}&location=${location}&limit=10`
- Maps API response shape `{ results: { jobs: { items, total }, opportunities: { items, total } } }` to tab counts and lists
- Passes `opp.opportunityType?.toLowerCase()` as `type` prop to OpportunityCard for color mapping
- Added loading spinner (FiLoader + "Searching..." text)
- Added error state with retry button
- Added empty result states for both jobs and opportunities tabs ("No jobs/opportunities found matching your search")
- Kept all existing UI: tab toggle, results header with sort dropdown, CV Service Nudge, JobCard/OpportunityCard rendering

**2. `src/app/(website)/search/page.jsx`** — Minimal change (1 line)
- Added `location={location}` and `initialType={type}` props to `<SearchResultsList>`

**3. `src/app/(website)/job/[slug]/page.jsx`** — Converted from mock to async API fetch
- Removed `import { jobDetail } from "../_components/mock-data"`
- Added `import { notFound } from "next/navigation"`
- Added `fetchJob(slug)` helper: fetches `/api/jobs/${slug}` with `cache: "no-store"`, returns null on 404/error
- Made `generateMetadata` async: fetches job, returns dynamic title/description from API data (falls back to "Job Not Found" if 404)
- Made page component `async`: fetches job, calls `notFound()` if null
- Normalizes API data: maps `company.employeeSize` → `company.size` for component compatibility
- Passes `similarJobs` from API response to `JobDetailSidebar`
- Passes `companyJobs={[]}` since API doesn't provide company jobs
- Added `|| 0` fallbacks for `applicantCount` references
- Kept all existing UI: breadcrumbs, ad leaderboard, header, pain trigger, body, service nudge, tools bar, sidebar, mobile apply bar

**4. `src/app/(website)/job/_components/JobDetailSidebar.jsx`** — Changed to props-based data
- Removed `import { similarJobs, companyJobs } from "./mock-data"`
- Changed function signature: `({ job })` → `({ job, similarJobs = [], companyJobs = [] })`
- All existing UI preserved — component now receives data via props instead of imports

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Search page is client component ("use client") — uses useEffect/useState/fetch pattern
- Job detail page is async server component — uses top-level await with fetch
- `params` is awaited (Next.js 15+ pattern: `const { slug } = await params`)
- API data normalized before passing to components to maintain backward compatibility
- No TypeScript used — all files are .jsx
- ESLint passes with zero errors on all 4 changed files

## Task ID: 8b-part2 - frontend-integrator
### Work Task
Wire 2 frontend page groups (Jobs Listing and Job Hub pages) to use real API data from `/api/jobs` instead of mock data.

### Work Summary
Replaced mock data with live API calls across 2 page groups (6 files modified, 2 new utility functions added). All existing UI preserved — only the data source changed.

**PAGE GROUP 1: Jobs Listing (`/jobs`)**

Files modified:
1. **`src/app/(website)/jobs/_components/JobsContent.jsx`** — Full rewrite of data layer:
   - Removed `allJobs` mock import; kept `trendingJobsSidebar` and `popularTags` (no API for sidebar data)
   - Added `useSearchParams()` to read `q` and `location` from URL (set by search hero)
   - Added state: `jobs`, `loading`, `totalJobs`, `totalPages`, `currentPage`, `sort`, `filters`
   - `useCallback` + `useEffect` fetches `/api/jobs?...` whenever filters/sort/page/searchParams change
   - `buildQueryString()` maps: URL `q` → `q`, sidebar `category` → `category`, `jobType`, `experienceLevel`, `location`, `isRemote`, plus `sort` and `page`/`limit`
   - `enrichJob()` maps API enum values to display strings via `formatJobType()`/`formatExperienceLevel()` and computes `isNew` (published < 24h ago) and `isUrgent` (deadline < 20 days away)
   - Loading spinner and empty state with "Clear all filters" button added
   - Pagination wired to API's `pagination.totalPages`
   - Scroll-to-top on page change

2. **`src/app/(website)/jobs/_components/JobFilters.jsx`** — Changed from internal state to controlled props:
   - Accepts `filters` object and `onFiltersChange` callback
   - Each filter group (category, jobType, experienceLevel, location) is now single-select
   - Remote toggle still controlled via `filters.isRemote`
   - Passes single-value arrays to `FilterSection` (compatible with existing checkbox UI)

3. **`src/app/(website)/jobs/_components/JobSortBar.jsx`** — Changed from internal to controlled:
   - Accepts `sort` and `onSortChange` props instead of `useState`
   - All existing UI (sort dropdown, mobile filter button) preserved

**PAGE GROUP 2: Job Hub Pages (`/jobs/[hubSlug]`)**

Files modified:
4. **`src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/_components/HubContent.jsx`** — Replaced mock data with API fetch:
   - Removed `mockHubJobs(hub)` import and `useMemo` client-side filtering
   - Added `useEffect` + `useState` for API fetch with 300ms search debounce
   - `buildHubQueryString()` iterates `hub.filters` object, skipping null/undefined values, appends `q`, `sort`, `page`, `limit`
   - Hub hero job count now uses `pagination.total` from API instead of `allJobs.length`
   - Service nudge applicant count uses `totalJobs` from API
   - Loading spinner and empty state added
   - Sidebar filters (`activeFilter`) kept as cosmetic (matching previous behavior — was never used in filtering)
   - All existing UI preserved: hero, search bar, sort, mobile filter drawer, job cards, pagination, service nudge, sidebar

5. **`src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/_components/hub-data.js`** — Removed `mockHubJobs` function:
   - Removed 160+ lines of mock job generation code
   - Kept `hubSidebarFilters()` and `getRelatedJobHubs()` (still used by UI)

**Shared utilities:**
6. **`src/lib/format.js`** — Added 2 new formatters:
   - `formatJobType(value)`: `"FULL_TIME"` → `"Full-time"`, `"PART_TIME"` → `"Part-time"`, `"CONTRACT"` → `"Contract"`, `"INTERNSHIP"` → `"Internship"`
   - `formatExperienceLevel(value)`: `"ENTRY"` → `"Entry Level"`, `"MID"` → `"Mid Level"`, `"SENIOR"` → `"Senior"`, `"MANAGER"` → `"Manager"`, `"EXECUTIVE"` → `"Executive"`

7. **`src/app/(website)/jobs/_components/mock-data.js`** — Updated filter values:
   - `filterCategories` values changed to API-compatible uppercase enums (e.g., `"Technology"` → `"TECHNOLOGY"`, `"Marketing"` → `"MARKETING_COMMUNICATIONS"`)
   - `filterJobTypes` values changed (e.g., `"Full-time"` → `"FULL_TIME"`)
   - `filterExperienceLevels` values changed (e.g., `"Entry"` → `"ENTRY"`, `"Senior"` → `"SENIOR"`)
   - Labels remain unchanged — UI stays identical

**Files NOT modified (no changes needed):**
- `src/app/(website)/jobs/page.jsx` — Server component, unchanged
- `src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/page.jsx` — Server component, unchanged
- `src/app/(website)/_components/JobCard.jsx` — Receives enriched job objects with display fields
- `src/app/(website)/_components/Pagination.jsx` — Works with new controlled state

**ESLint: zero errors on all modified files.**

## Task ID: 8c - api-integration
### Work Task
1. Fix Jobs listing sidebar trending jobs to fetch from API instead of mock data
2. Wire Job Hub pages sidebar filters to API query params

### Work Summary

**Task 1: Fix Jobs listing sidebar trending jobs (`src/app/(website)/jobs/_components/JobsContent.jsx`)**
- Removed `import { trendingJobsSidebar, popularTags } from "./mock-data"` — no more mock-data dependency for this component
- Added `const [trendingJobs, setTrendingJobs] = useState([])` state
- Added `useEffect` on mount to fetch `/api/jobs?sort=featured&limit=5` — API supports `sort=featured` (orders by `isFeatured desc, publishedAt desc`) and returns jobs with `company` relation (`name`, `slug`, `logoColor`, `isVerified`)
- Moved `popularTags` inline as a static const array (12 search terms: CPA-K, IFRS, Excel, QuickBooks, etc.) — not DB data, just label strings
- Updated sidebar JSX: `trendingJobsSidebar.map(...)` → `trendingJobs.map(...)` with proper nested company access: `job.company?.name` (was `job.company`), `job.company?.logoColor` (was `job.logoColor`)
- Added fallback empty state message "No trending jobs yet" when array is empty
- Used optional chaining (`?.`) throughout for null-safety on API data

**Task 2: Wire Job Hub sidebar filters to API (`src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/_components/HubContent.jsx`)**
- Note: The hub page already fetched from `/api/jobs?${qs}` using `hub.filters` from `hub-config.js` — no mock job data was used. However, the `activeFilter` state (sidebar FilterList selection) was tracked but NOT passed to the API query.
- Added `mapSidebarFilter(hubSlug, filterValue)` function that converts sidebar filter label values to API query params:
  - **Location hubs** (nairobi/mombasa/kisumu/nakuru): category slugs → `category` enum (e.g., "technology" → "TECHNOLOGY")
  - **Remote hub**: job type labels → `jobType` enum on top of base `isRemote=true` filter (e.g., "full-time" → "FULL_TIME")
  - **Default/category hubs**: job type labels → `jobType` enum (e.g., "full-time" → "FULL_TIME", "remote" → `isRemote=true`)
  - **Special hubs** (internships, part-time, entry-level): unmappable values (paid, weekend, trainee) → fallback as `q` search term
- Updated `buildHubQueryString()` to accept `activeFilter` and `hubSlug` params, merging mapped filter params into the query
- Added search query merging: if sidebar filter sets `q` and user also types a search, they combine as `"filterValue searchTerm"`
- Added `activeFilter` to `fetchJobs` useCallback dependency array so API refetches when sidebar filter changes
- Verified `hub-data.js` exports (`getRelatedJobHubs`, `hubSidebarFilters`) remain as static config — they derive from `hub-config.js`, not DB data
- Verified `page.jsx` for hub route already passes `hub` prop correctly with `filters` from `hub-config.js`

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/(website)/jobs/_components/JobsContent.jsx` — removed mock import, added trending API fetch, inline popularTags
- `src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/_components/HubContent.jsx` — added `mapSidebarFilter()`, wired `activeFilter` to API query builder

**Files NOT modified (verified correct as-is):**
- `src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/_components/hub-data.js` — static config functions, no DB data
- `src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/page.jsx` — already passes hub object with filters correctly
- `src/app/(website)/jobs/[hubSlug]/_components/HubSearchBar.jsx` — already wired correctly
- `src/config/hub-config.js` — read-only reference for filter mapping

**ESLint:** Both modified files pass with zero errors. Pre-existing errors in other files (opportunities hub, require-imports) are unrelated.

## Task ID: 8e - full-stack-developer
### Work Task
Wire 3 pages to API data: Organizations Listing (verify), Organization Profile (convert to async + fetch), and Homepage (convert to async + fetch from multiple APIs + update sidebar to props-based). All files must be `.jsx` (no TypeScript).

### Work Summary

**Created 1 new file:**

**1. `/src/lib/normalize.js`** — Data normalization helpers that transform API responses into shapes expected by UI components:
- `getInitials(name)` — "Safaricom PLC" → "SP"
- `formatTimeLeft(deadline)` — "5h 23m", "1d 5h", "12d"
- `normalizeJobForCard(job)` / `normalizeJobs(jobs)` — Formats `jobType` (FULL_TIME → Full-time) and `experienceLevel` (SENIOR → Senior) from DB enum to display strings
- `normalizeCompany(company, pagination)` — Builds `description` array, `keyDetails` grid, `stats` object, `initials`, `location` from city/country
- `normalizeSimilarCompanies(companies)` — Adds `initials`, maps `jobCount` → `openJobs`
- `normalizeOpportunity(opp)` / `normalizeOpportunities(opportunities)` — Adds lowercase `type` for color mapping

**Part 1: Organizations Listing (`/organizations/page.jsx`)** — No changes needed. The `OrganizationsContent.jsx` client component already receives `companies` as props from the parent server component. No `/api/companies` listing route exists, so mock data is kept for this page.

**Part 2: Organization Profile (`/organizations/[slug]/page.jsx`)** — Fully rewired:
- Removed all mock-data imports (`company`, `companyJobs`, `similarCompanies`)
- Added `notFound()` import from `next/navigation`
- `generateMetadata()` now fetches from `/api/companies/${slug}` to build dynamic SEO title/description
- Page function fetches from `/api/companies/${slug}` with `{ next: { revalidate: 60 } }` ISR caching
- Returns `notFound()` on 404 or fetch errors
- Uses `normalizeCompany()` to build description array, keyDetails, stats, initials from raw API company
- Uses `normalizeJobs()` to format jobType/experienceLevel for JobCard
- Uses `normalizeSimilarCompanies()` to build sidebar list with initials
- `browseIndustries` kept as static config (no API for industry counts)
- Filter pills changed from `<button>` to `<span>` (display-only, no client handler needed)
- Pagination now dynamically rendered from API `pagination.totalPages`
- Website link in keyDetails now uses `<a>` with `target="_blank"`

**Part 3: Homepage (`/page.jsx`) + `HomepageSidebar.jsx`** — Fully rewired:
- `page.jsx` converted from sync server component to async server component
- Fetches 5 API endpoints in parallel via `Promise.allSettled()`:
  - `/api/jobs?sort=featured&limit=5` → featuredJobs
  - `/api/jobs?sort=newest&limit=10` → latestJobs
  - `/api/jobs?jobType=INTERNSHIP&limit=5` → internshipJobs
  - `/api/opportunities?sort=newest&limit=5` → opportunities
  - `/api/jobs?sort=deadline&limit=10` → deadline jobs (filtered for 7-day window)
- Graceful fallback: if API returns empty/error, falls back to mock-data
- Sidebar data derived from API responses: topEmployers (deduplicated company map from jobs), sidebarFeaturedJobs (first 4 featured), sidebarDeadlines (computed via `formatTimeLeft`)
- Categories, trustedLogos, locations kept as static constants in page.jsx
- Conditional rendering: Featured Jobs, Urgent Deadlines, Internships, Scholarships sections only render if data exists
- `HomepageSidebar.jsx` converted from importing mock-data to accepting all data as props: `topEmployers`, `sidebarFeaturedJobs`, `sidebarDeadlines`, `locations`
- HomepageSidebar sections conditionally render when their prop arrays have data

**ESLint:** Zero errors on all changed/new files (9 pre-existing errors in prisma seed files are unrelated).

## Task ID: 8d - api-wiring
### Work Task
Wire Opportunities listing, Opportunity hub pages, Career Advice listing, and Career Advice article detail pages to real API endpoints instead of mock data. All files must be .jsx (no TypeScript).

### Work Summary
Replaced all mock data imports with live API calls across 4 page groups (15 files modified). ESLint passes with zero errors on `src/app`.

**Part 1: Opportunities Listing (`/opportunities`)**
- `src/app/(website)/opportunities/page.jsx` — Converted to async server component. Fetches featured (`/api/opportunities?sort=featured&limit=10`) and all opportunities (`/api/opportunities?limit=20`) in parallel via `Promise.all`. Related hubs sidebar derived statically from `hub-config.js` using `getOpportunityHubs()`. Collection JSON-LD uses real `totalOpportunities` from API. Passes `totalOpportunities` to hero via prop.
- `src/app/(website)/opportunities/_components/OpportunitySearchHero.jsx` — Accepts `totalOpportunities` prop instead of importing `opportunityStats` from mock-data. Simplified stats to show only total count from API.
- `src/app/(website)/opportunities/_components/OpportunityFilters.jsx` — Moved `opportunityTypes` array inline (removed mock-data import). All other logic unchanged.

**Part 2: Opportunity Hub Pages (`/opportunities/[hubSlug]`)**
- `src/app/(website)/opportunities/[hubSlug]/_components/HubContent.jsx` — Converted from mock data to client-side API fetching. Uses `buildQueryString(hub)` to construct filter params from `hub.filters` (opportunityType, category, location, isRemote). Fetches featured items and paginated results from `/api/opportunities`. Added loading spinner, error state with retry button, and wired `Pagination` component for server-side pagination. Search and sort trigger refetch.
- `src/app/(website)/opportunities/[hubSlug]/_components/hub-data.js` — Removed `mockHubOpportunities()` function. Kept `getRelatedOpportunityHubs()` as static config derived from `hub-config.js`.

**Part 3: Career Advice Listing (`/career-advice`)**
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/page.jsx` — Converted to async server component. Fetches featured (`/api/articles?sort=featured&limit=10`) and all articles (`/api/articles?limit=20`) in parallel. Sidebar categories and popular tags kept as static config (no API needed). `collectionJsonLd.totalItems` comes from API total.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/_components/CareerAdviceClient.jsx` — Removed `categorySlugs` import from mock-data. Category filtering now matches against `a.category?.slug` or `a.category?.name` (API returns `{id, name, slug, color}` objects).
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/_components/FeaturedArticle.jsx` — Updated to handle API article shape: `category?.name`, `author?.name`, `author?.initials` computed from name. Handles null/undefined safely with optional chaining.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/_components/PopularArticles.jsx` — Converted to client component that fetches from `/api/articles?sort=popular&limit=5`. Shows loading state. Displays `viewsCount` from API.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/_components/ArticleCategoryPills.jsx` — Moved `categories` array inline (removed mock-data import).

**Part 4: Career Advice Article Detail (`/career-advice/[slug]`)**
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/[slug]/page.jsx` — Converted to async server component. Fetches from `/api/articles/${slug}` with `{ cache: "no-store" }`. Calls `notFound()` on 404. Dynamic metadata from API data (title, subtitle/excerpt, publishedTime, modifiedTime). Author data normalized with fallbacks (initials computed from name, bio/social/counts from author object). Falls back to `getArticleHtml()` if `article.content` is empty. Related articles use API data with computed gradient/pill colors.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/[slug]/_components/ArticleHeader.jsx` — Updated for API shape: null-safe access to `author.name`, `author.title`, `author.initials`. Category from string prop. Subtitle, readingTime, viewsCount all optional.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/[slug]/_components/ArticleBody.jsx` — Added null check for `htmlContent` (won't render dangerouslySetInnerHTML if empty).
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/[slug]/_components/AuthorBio.jsx` — Full defensive coding: returns null if no author name. All fields accessed via optional chaining. Defaults for initials, bio, linkedin, twitter, stats.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/[slug]/_components/ArticleSidebar.jsx` — Removed unused `activeReaction` state. Kept as pure presentational client component.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/[slug]/_components/ShareButtons.jsx` — Defensive: uses `article?.slug` and `article?.title`.
- `src/app/(website)/career-advice/[slug]/_components/ArticleTags.jsx` — Handles both string tags and `{name}` objects. Returns null for empty array.

**Technical Notes:**
- All server-side fetches use `cache: "no-store"` for fresh data
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` fallback to `http://localhost:3000` for server-side fetches
- API response shapes differ from mock data (e.g., `category` is object not string, `author` has different fields) — all components updated for API shape
- mock-data.js files NOT deleted (kept for reference) — just no longer imported
- All 15 modified files pass ESLint with zero errors

## Task ID: 8b-org - fullstack-developer
### Work Task
Create the missing `/api/companies/route.js` API endpoint and wire the Organizations listing page to use it instead of mock data.

### Work Summary
Completed all 3 steps:

**1. Created `/api/companies/route.js`**
- GET endpoint with filtering (industry, location, size, search) and pagination (page, limit)
- Sort options: featured (isFeatured desc, jobCount desc), newest (createdAt desc), name (asc), jobs (jobCount desc)
- Selects 14 fields from Company model: id, name, slug, logo, logoColor, tagline, industry, city, country, employeeSize, isFeatured, isVerified, jobCount, website
- Returns `{ companies, pagination: { page, limit, total, totalPages, hasNext, hasPrev } }`
- Uses case-insensitive `contains` for all text filters
- Skips "All Industries" / "All Locations" / "All Sizes" sentinel values
- Follows exact same pattern as existing `/api/jobs/route.js`

**2. Rewired Organizations page (`/organizations/page.jsx`)**
- Removed `import { companies } from "./_components/mock-data"`
- Added `fetchCompanies()` async function using `fetch()` to `/api/companies?limit=50&sort=featured` with `cache: "no-store"`
- Converted page from sync function to `async` server component
- Passes fetched `companies` array to `<OrganizationsContent companies={companies} />`
- Preserved all existing SEO metadata, JSON-LD (breadcrumbs + collection), hero section, breadcrumbs nav exactly as-is

**3. Updated OrganizationsContent and CompanyCard for API data shape**
- **CompanyCard.jsx**: Added `getInitials()` helper to compute initials from `company.name` (fallback if `company.initials` missing). Mapped fields: `company.openJobs` -> `company.jobCount`, `company.location` -> `company.city`, `company.size` -> `company.employeeSize`. Added support for `company.logo` (renders `<img>` when available, falls back to initials). Shows `company.tagline || company.industry` as subtitle. Conditionally renders location/size row only when values exist.
- **OrganizationsContent.jsx**: Updated filtering to use `c.city` instead of `c.location`. Updated featured companies threshold to use `c.jobCount ?? c.openJobs`. Added `getInitials()` helper for sidebar featured companies list. Updated job count display to `company.jobCount ?? company.openJobs ?? 0`. Sidebar logos now render `<img>` when `company.logo` is available.
- **CompanyFilters.jsx**: Left unchanged - still imports filter option arrays (`industries`, `companySizes`, `locations`) from `mock-data.js` which are just label arrays, not company data.

All 4 modified files pass ESLint with zero errors.

## Task IDs: 8c-overview, 8c-saved, 8c-apps - fullstack-dev
### Work Task
Wire 3 Dashboard pages (Overview, Saved Jobs, Applications) to use real API data instead of mock data.

### Work Summary
Replaced all hardcoded mock data in 3 dashboard pages with live API fetches. All pages now use `useSession` from next-auth/react for auth state, fetch from authenticated API endpoints on mount, and handle loading/error states with skeletons.

**1. Dashboard Overview (`src/app/dashboard/_components/DashboardOverview.jsx`)**
- Removed `MOCK_USER`, `JOB_SEEKER_STATS`, `EMPLOYER_STATS`, `RECENT_ACTIVITY` constants
- Added `useSession` to get user name from session (first name extracted for greeting)
- Added `useState` for `statsData`, `recentActivity`, `loading`, `error`
- Added `useEffect` to fetch from `GET /api/dashboard/stats` on authenticated state
- Built dynamic stats cards from API response (Job Seeker: Applications Sent, Saved Jobs, Notifications, Job Alerts; Employer: Active Jobs, Total Applications, Shortlisted, Interviews)
- Mapped `recent.savedJobs` to activity items with Bookmark icon and clickable links to job slugs
- Added `LoadingSkeleton` component with animated placeholder cards matching layout
- Added unauthenticated state with sign-in prompt card
- Added empty activity state with Clock icon
- Preserved Profile Completeness section and Quick Actions

**2. Saved Jobs Page (`src/app/dashboard/saved-jobs/page.jsx`)**
- Removed `INITIAL_SAVED_JOBS` mock data array
- Added `useSession` for auth guard, `useRouter` for potential redirects
- Added `useState` for `savedJobs`, `total`, `loading`, `error`, `unsavingId`
- Added `useEffect` to fetch from `GET /api/saved-jobs` on mount
- Rewrote `handleUnsave` to call `DELETE /api/saved-jobs` with `{ jobId }` body, then refresh list
- Added loading spinner on unsave button (`Loader2` icon) during DELETE request
- Mapped API response fields: `job.company.name` → company, `getInitials()` → initials, `job.company.logoColor` → inline style backgroundColor, `formatSalary(salaryMin, salaryMax)` → salary string, `formatJobType(jobType)` → "Full-Time" format
- Added clickable job title links to `/jobs/${slug}` and "View" button links
- Added full-page loading skeleton with 6 placeholder cards
- Added unauthenticated error state with sign-in prompt

**3. Applications Page (`src/app/dashboard/applications/page.jsx`)**
- Removed `MOCK_APPLICATIONS` mock data array
- Added `useSession` for auth guard
- Added `useState` for `applications`, `totalCount`, `loading`, `error`, `activeTab`
- Added `useEffect` with `activeTab` dependency to fetch from `GET /api/applications?status={activeTab}` (no status param for "all" tab)
- Mapped API response: `app.job.title` → jobTitle, `app.job.company.name` → company, `getInitials()` → initials, `app.job.company.logoColor` → inline style, `formatJobType(jobType)` → type, `app.createdAt` → appliedDate
- Added clickable job title and "View Job" button links to `/jobs/${slug}`
- Added tab-level loading skeleton with animated pulse cards
- Status counts on tabs show "..." for inactive tabs (since we don't have a counts-only endpoint)
- Preserved all STATUS_CONFIG styling for APPLIED, SHORTLISTED, INTERVIEW, REJECTED, OFFERED

**Helper functions** added to each file that needs them:
- `formatJobType(type)` — "FULL_TIME" → "Full-Time"
- `formatSalary(min, max)` — 180000/250000 → "KSh 180K - 250K"
- `getInitials(name)` — "Safaricom PLC" → "SP"

**Key design decisions:**
- Company logo colors use `style={{ backgroundColor: logoColor }}` instead of Tailwind classes (API returns hex values)
- All three pages handle 3 states: session loading → data loading → content (with error/unauth states)
- Loading skeletons match the exact layout structure of the content they replace
- ESLint: zero errors on all 3 files

## Task ID: 8c-alerts, 8c-profile - fullstack-developer
### Work Task
Wire 2 Dashboard pages (Alerts and Profile) to use real API data instead of hardcoded mock data.

### Work Summary

#### Task 8c-alerts: Wire Alerts Page
**File modified:** `src/app/dashboard/alerts/_components/AlertsContent.jsx`

**Changes made:**
- Removed `INITIAL_ALERTS` hardcoded mock data (3 fake alerts)
- Added `useState` for `alerts` (initialized to `[]`), `loading`, `error`, and `creating` states
- Added `useEffect` with `fetchAlerts()` callback to call `GET /api/alerts` on component mount
- Mapped API response fields to display: `alert.query` for keyword, `alert.category`, `"DAILY"` constant for frequency, `emailOpenCount + emailClickCount` for email interactions, `alert.lastSentAt` for last sent date
- **Toggle action:** Calls `PUT /api/alerts` with `{ id, isActive: !current }` — implements optimistic UI update with revert on failure, then refreshes list
- **Delete action:** Calls `DELETE /api/alerts` with `{ id }` — optimistic delete with re-fetch fallback on error
- **Create action:** Calls `POST /api/alerts` with `{ keyword, location, categoryId, frequency }` — shows loading spinner on button, refreshes list on success
- Added loading state (full-page spinner with `Loader2` icon)
- Added error state (red error card with "Try Again" button for blocking errors)
- Added non-blocking error banner for action failures (toggle/delete/create) that appears when data exists
- Added `Loader2` and `AlertCircle` imports from lucide-react
- Kept all existing UI: Card, Badge, Button, Input, Label, Switch, Dialog, Select, Separator, etc.
- Kept `CATEGORIES` array as static config

#### Task 8c-profile: Wire Profile Page
**File modified:** `src/app/dashboard/profile/page.jsx`

**Changes made:**
- Removed `INITIAL_PROFILE` hardcoded mock data
- Added `useState` for `profile` (initialized to `null`), `loading`, `error` states
- Added `useEffect` with `fetchProfile()` callback to call `GET /api/user/profile` on component mount
- Mapped API response to local profile state: split `user.name` into `firstName`/`lastName`, mapped `email`, `phone`, `location`, `bio`, `linkedinUrl`, `education` (string), `skills` (array)
- **Save action:** Calls `PUT /api/user/profile` with `{ name: firstName + lastName, bio, location, linkedinUrl, education, skills }` — replaces fake `setTimeout` simulation
- Made `email` and `phone` fields disabled (read-only) since API doesn't support changing them through this endpoint
- Made `portfolioUrl` field disabled with "Portfolio URL coming soon" note (no API field)
- **Removed Work Experience tab** entirely (no API field for experience data)
- **Removed "Add Education" button** — replaced structured education cards with a simple text display card + editable `Textarea` below for updating the education string
- Made `COMPLETION_SECTIONS` dynamic based on actual data: checks if firstName+email filled, education exists, skills array has items
- Added loading state (full-page spinner)
- Added error state (red error card with retry)
- Added non-blocking error banner for save failures
- Removed unused imports: `Separator` import kept (still used), removed `Trash2` (no longer removing education items), removed `handleRemoveEducation` and `handleRemoveExperience` handlers
- Added `Loader2`, `AlertCircle` imports; removed unused `User` import, kept `Lock` import for reference
- Kept all existing UI components: Card, Badge, Button, Input, Label, Textarea, Progress, Separator, Tabs, etc.

#### ESLint
Both files pass ESLint with zero errors.

#### API Endpoints Used (pre-existing, no changes needed):
- `GET /api/alerts` → `{ alerts: [...] }`
- `POST /api/alerts` → body: `{ keyword, location, categoryId, frequency }`
- `PUT /api/alerts` → body: `{ id, isActive }`
- `DELETE /api/alerts` → body: `{ id }`
- `GET /api/user/profile` → `{ user: { name, email, phone, location, bio, linkedinUrl, education, skills, ... } }`
- `PUT /api/user/profile` → body: `{ name, bio, location, linkedinUrl, education, skills }`
